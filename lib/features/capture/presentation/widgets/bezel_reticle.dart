/// the thing that will appear on the wall — and it can carry the progress, which
/// a circle could not.
///
/// ## The progress
///
/// The ring fills **clockwise from twelve o'clock** with [progress], in green,
/// over a white base. When [completed] the whole ring is green. Nothing here
/// reports "aligned": the base colour is driven by the caller's
/// `withinTolerance`, which comes from the unsmoothed pose, so a ring that looks
/// settled cannot appear while the phone is still moving.
