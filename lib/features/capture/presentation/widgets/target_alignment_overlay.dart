/// *had been* — a pointer that disagrees with the arithmetic it is supposed to
/// be a picture of. Display smoothing costs jitter; it also costs truth, and
/// the direction is the part the user acts on.
///
/// What stays display-only is the ring's **fill**: [stabilityProgress] is the
/// hold, and [withinTolerance] is the raw alignment, so a ring cannot look
/// settled while the phone is still moving.

/// from. Projecting it with ARCore's own camera matrix puts the pointer, the
/// GLB the renderer draws at the anchor and the sentence on one
/// world → camera → screen chain.
///
/// **Why not the display-filtered direction.** [AlignmentResult.pointerDirection]
/// is de-jittered for the marker, but the arrow is an instruction the user acts
/// on *now*: a smoothed bearing lags a real turn by a few frames and can keep
/// telling the user to turn after they have already arrived. The filter is
/// display-only by design, so the pointer reads the unsmoothed truth.
///
/// **Why not `atan2(−pitchCorrection, yawCorrection)`.** Those are angles, and
/// the pixel offset a direction produces is `fx·tan(yaw)` by `fy·tan(pitch)` —
/// the two focal lengths are not equal on a portrait display (`fy` is roughly
/// 1.6× `fx` for the shipped field of view), and even with square pixels the
/// `tan` is nonlinear. An arrow built from the angles is therefore right in
/// every quadrant and wrong in every diagonal: a 20°/20° error draws an arrow
/// about 14° away from where the marker actually is. Projecting the
/// camera-frame direction — which [AlignmentResult.directionInCamera] already
/// is — costs one call and removes the discrepancy, including the poles, where
/// the same call has no yaw to get wrong.
///
/// A target that is off screen is handled by [projectWithArCoreProjection]
/// itself: it pins the direction to the viewport edge along its own projected
/// bearing, and the shaft is clipped there. A target **behind** the camera has
/// no screen position at all; it gets the same edge bearing plus a second
/// chevron, so "keep turning" stays visually distinct from "the marker is just
/// outside the frame". When the target is exactly behind, the projection has no
/// x/y bearing to use, so the sign of the signed yaw correction picks the edge
/// to turn toward.
///
/// It disappears once the error is inside tolerance: at that point the ring's
/// fill is the whole message, and an arrow pointing at nothing is noise. That is
/// display-only — arming the shutter still reads
/// `CaptureState.captureBlockReason`, which never consults the arrow.
